Arrays
-How are they stored in Memory? 
    + in sequence, contiguous.
    + The memory that the operating system gives you is all in a line.
    + memory address plus the number of bits. 
    5000    5004    5008    5012    5016
     1        2       3       4       5
    my_arr[0]   my_arr[1]   my_arr[2]   my_arr[3]   my_arr[4]

    bits are just 1 or 0
    8 bits = 1 byte
    bit = Binary unit

    Increase the size of the array by 1 more slot
        + move array and add one slot. copy over array one at a time. O(n)
        + insert between 1 and 2
            - shift over 2 and on one of a time copy and overwrite. O(n)

HashFunctions -----
-give hash function a key. Hash function takes in the key and returns an index in the array that we store the key and value together
-to get back our key and and value. Hash functions take in key, creates the index and give us back the value. 

--can not have a random hash function. 
--must be Deterministic


Built in ones examples
- djb2
- sha256
- bcrypt
- 


+ Hash scramble. Salt is number some prime number. 

+ Hash Function produces a Hash. 

+ Using a Hash Function in a Hash Table you want it to be fast.

+ Why would you want a Hash Function to be slow: 
    --when using it to encrypt passwords/ user info so that it takes longer for hackers
    -- to secure information
